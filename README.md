# python-api-challenge

A two-part exercise to generate a data set of random cities, pull weather data, and look at trends and correlations based on various metrics relevant to city latitude.
In the second part, weather data from the first part will be used to find and map perfect vacation spots, and to locate a hotel in each city.
Both parts use data libraries and API calls to generate information and linear regression and visualizations to draw conclusions.
